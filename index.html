  I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Knowledge Intergration at University of Waterloo, and am cross-appointed to Sociology & Legal Studies, the School of Environment, Resources, & Sustainability, and Geography & Environmental Management. I primarily work in the areas of social network analysis and computational social science, with substantive interests in the science-policy interface, environmental governance, and social movements. My work is currently funded by 8 research grants, including an Early Researcher Award from the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation and 5 grants from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC). On the teaching side of things, I’m especially passionate about teaching research methods and courses that integrate data science and the social sciences.

  As a computational social scientist, my most general research goal is to advance our knowledge of how social networks and institutions affect the spread of information, knowledge, beliefs, biases, and behaviours through populations. Of course, my work is also focused on better understanding the social and political consequences of those complex diffusion processes. I am currently involved in a number of research projects in service of that larger goal. Each combines computational methods (specifically related to network analysis, natural language processing and text analysis, and record linkage) with social scientific theories and methods.

  <!-- For example, I am the Princpal Investigator (PI) on a large project about the adoption of open and proprietary approaches to science in biomedical research and development networks. The main objective for this project is to understand how national science policies and collaboration networks affect key decisions that labs make about how to conduct and disseminate scientific research. To that end, my students and I have been collecting, linking, and analyzing large datasets on biomedical research and development in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, and France. Soon we will be epanding the analysis to include other countries. This project, like others I am involved in, combines

  In addition to the project described above, I am currently collaborating on a range of projects in environmental sociology and the sociology of education.

  In addition to my normal research and teaching life, I have the privilege of working with Eric Kennedy on <a href="http://sotlnorth.ca">Science Outside the Lab North</a> (SOtL North). SOtL North is a week long intensive course in science policy held annually in Ottawa and Montréal. Each course cohort is ~ 14 graduate students from science and engineering disciplines across Canada.
