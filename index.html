<p>
  I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Knowledge Integration at University of Waterloo, and am cross-appointed to Sociology & Legal Studies, the School of Environment, Resources, & Sustainability (SERS), and Geography & Environmental Management (GEM). I'm also a Policy Fellow at the <a href="https://www.balsillieschool.ca">Balsillie School of International Affairs</a> and a Member of the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/cybersecurity-privacy-institute/"> Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute</a> at the University of Waterloo. <a href="http://www.johnmclevey.com/research/">I primarily work in the areas of social network analysis and computational social science, with substantive interests in (1) science, technology, and democracy, and (2) environmental governance and social movements.</a> My work is funded by research grants from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and an Early Researcher Award from the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation. On the teaching side of things, I’m especially passionate about teaching research methods and courses that integrate the social sciences and data science.
</p>

<p>I am currently involved in a number of inter-related research projects. (1) I am in the early stages of a new research project that uses large-scale social media data and methods from computational social science to better understand (<emph>i.</emph>) the effects of state-sponsored and domestic disinformation campaigns on online political discussions, and <emph>ii.</emph> the diffusion of misinformation and disinformation online. Collaborators include Anabel Quan-Haase (Western University), David Tindall (University of British Columbia), Martin Innes (Cardiff University), Darrin Durant (University of Melbourne), Deena Abul-Fottouh (University of Toronto), and Owen Gallupe (University of Waterloo). (2) I am a Co-Investigator for a research project that uses advances in social network analysis to better understand the role of face-to-face and digital networks in eliciting engagement in climate action. (3) I am a Co-Investigator or collaborator on a series of projects that are broadly about environmental governance, especially in coastal environments. (4) I am a collaborator on a project with Janice Aurini (University of Waterloo), Allyson Stokes (Memorial University), Rob Gorbet (University of Waterloo), and Jessica Rizk (University of Waterloo)on the changing connections between education systems and work. Finally, (5) I am involved in a number of research projects related to the structure and dynamics of teams in science and technology, especially biomedical research and developent and open source software development. Each of these projects combines computational methods (specifically related to network analysis, natural language processing and text analysis, and record linkage) with social scientific theories and methods.</p>

<!-- <p>
  As a computational social scientist, my most general research goal is to advance our knowledge of how social networks and institutions affect cognition and behaviour, including the formation and diffusion of knowledge, beliefs, biases, and behaviours. Of course, my work is also focused on better understanding the social and political consequences of those complex transmission processes. <a href="http://www.johnmclevey.com/research/">I am currently involved in a number of research projects in service of that larger goal.</a> Each combines computational methods (specifically related to network analysis, natural language processing and text analysis, and record linkage) with social scientific theories and methods.

<p>
  In addition to these research projects, I am writing a book called <em>Doing Computational Social Science</em> for Sage. If you are interested in reviewing a draft chapter or two, please do get in touch.

<p>
  In addition to writing articles and books, I am co-developing research software with <a href="http://networkslab.org/page/about/">student members of my research team</a>. You can learn more about <a href="http://networkslab.org/metaknowledge/">metaknowledge</a> and our other research software on my <a href="http://networkslab.org/">NetLab</a> website. I published an article about metaknowledge with my former student Reid McIlroy-Young in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157716302000">Journal of Informetrics</a>.

<p>
  At the University of Waterloo, I primarily teach courses on research methods and design, computational social science, science and public policy, and the art and science of learning. I also run the Knowledge Integration senior honours project course. I primarily work with graduate students from the Department of Sociology & Legal Studies, but I have also worked with students from various departments in the Faculty of Environment and the Faculty of Applied Health Sciences.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to my normal research and teaching life, I have the privilege of working with <a href="http://ericbkennedy.ca">Eric Kennedy</a> on <a href="http://sotlnorth.ca">Science Outside the Lab North</a> (SOtL North). SOtL North is a week long intensive course in science policy held annually in Ottawa and Montréal. Each course cohort is ~ 14 graduate students from science and engineering disciplines across Canada. Please feel free to email one of us if you are interested in learning more about this program.
