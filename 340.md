# Course Description

This course provides an introduction to empirical research design and methods with a focus on applications in the social sciences and related fields. You will learn about core issues in research design (e.g. sampling) that transcend specific approaches, and about a variety of techniques for collecting and analyzing quantitative and qualitative data. The course will cover both abstract and practical issues related to methodology and decision making in empirical research. You will have the opportunity to develop and workshop proposals that you may wish to pursue in your senior honors thesis. By the end of the course you will be a more informed consumer and have a basic set of skills for designing and implementing your own empirical research projects. Most importantly, you will have a foundation for future learning about research design and methods.

# Learning Objectives

The <a href="#sched">Schedule</a> section of the syllabus identifies the core learning objectives for every scheduled topic in the course.
# Books

There are 2 books that we will read cover to cover. They are available on reserve at the university library (Porter), in the university bookstore, and  online.

<i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Earl Babbie and Lance Roberts. 2018. *Fundamentals of Social Research.* Nelson.](https://www.amazon.ca/Fundamentals-Social-Research-Earl-Babbie/dp/017657011X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1512437506&sr=8-1&keywords=Fundamentals+of+Social+Research)

This book is used in other research methods classes on campus, so you should be able to find used copies without too much difficulty. If for some reason you can't get this edition, it's OK to use a previous one. However, you *must* talk to me about how you can compensate for differences in the content across editions. **If at all possible**, I would prefer for you to use the 4th edition (i.e. the 2017 edition).

<i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Matthew Salganik. 2017. *Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age.* Princeton University Press.](http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/preface/)

You can currently read Salganik's book for free online at [http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/preface/](http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/preface/). I am not sure if / when that will change.

Any other readings will be available on the course website, on reserve, or through the library database.

##     Comprehension Quizzes


There are no exams in this course, but there are many short quizzes to test your comprehension of the readings and other class material. You can do them on your own time, wherever you want, with or without your textbook, but **you must complete them independently**. No collaboration of any kind. The quizzes will be due at **9 pm on every Monday and Wednesday between January 8 and March 14th, except reading week**. LEARN will not let you submit a late quiz. If you need to submit late, please email me a medical note and request that I re-open the quiz for you.<br><br>Each quiz will consist exclusively of multiple choice and, in some cases, true / false questions. You should expect each quiz to have a lot of questions (usually between 30 and 60), but if you have done the readings carefully you should be able to complete each quiz in less than 20-30 minutes. <br><br>I suggest that you: (1) do the assigned readings carefully; (2) answer as many questions as you can without consulting your book; (3) when you get to the end of the quiz, go back to your book and re-read the sections that explain content you were unsure about; (4) go back to your quiz and answer the remaining questions, and (5) Submit! <br><br> Obviously it will take you longer than 20 minutes to do each quiz if you use this strategy, but the extra time you invest will pay off. <a href="https://makeitstick.net">This approach will help you learn better and more efficiently</a>. You will retain more information from each chapter, which will help you avoid problems later in the term.<br><br>Each quiz will cover content from the **readings that are scheduled for the upcoming class.** In other words, the quiz covering the readings for January 9th's class on "theory-driven empirical research" will cover Chapter 1 "Human Inquiry and Science" from Babbie & Roberts (2018) *Fundamentals of Social Research*. The quiz will become available on LEARN after class on Thursday January 4th, and will close on Monday January 8th.<br><br>Why have I decided to quiz you on readings before we cover them in class? And why are there so many questions on each quiz? Reasonable questions... The main reason why I have scheduled the quizzes this way is because it enables me to tailor our class meetings to meet your intellectual needs as they evolve throughout the semester. Every Tuesday and Thursday morning, I will look at the results of the quiz you submitted the night before. If necessary, I will revise my notes for the class meeting to clarify things you seem to be struggling with. Similarly, the reason I have included so many questions on each quiz is because I need to know exactly what you don't understand. If I ask you a few questions about each of the key concepts from each chapter, then there end up being a lot of questions on each quiz. I think that's fair, since all the questions are multiple choice and true / false.<br><br>I have enabled auto-grading for the quizzes on LEARN. That means that you will get your evaluation as soon as you finish the quiz, and you will be able to see the correct answers for all questions. I set it up this way to help you learn <a href="https://makeitstick.net">as efficiently as possible</a>.<br><br><!-- Everyone has bad days, so I will automatically drop your lowest quiz grade. That means each quiz will be worth 2.5% of your final course grade (40/16 = 2.5). -->
## Class Facilitation


You will collaborate with 4-5 students (approximately 1/4 of the class as of January 3rd) on a 30 minute class covering one chapter from Matthew Salganik's book *Bit by Bit*. Eligible chapters are: "Observing Behavior," "Asking Questions," "Running Experiments," and "Mass Collaboration." We will pick collaborators and chapters in class on February 15th. The student-led classes will happen on March 22 and 27.<br><br>You and your collaborators should begin with an overview of the core arguments from the chapter. You should explicitly relate those arguments to relevant material covered in the Babbie and Roberts' textbook or in previous class discussions. For example, if you are covering the *Bit by Bit* chapter "Asking Questions," you should connect the key arguments to content on survey methodology and qualitative interviews covered in Babbie and Roberts. Once you and your collaborators have reviewed the key material from your *Bit by Bit* chapter, you should pose questions for class discussion. <br><br>Each chapter in *Bit by Bit* includes a technical appendix, further commentary, and a list of potential activities. It is **not necessary** for you to cover any of this material in your 30 minute class, but you should pick a couple of activities that you think are especially interesting or useful. If both groups stick to 30 minutes, there will be 20 minutes of remaining class time on March 22 and 27th. We will use that time to start (and maybe finish) one of the activities. <!-- You will write a <= 2,500 word proposal (again, don't waste words!) for an empirical research project. You may write the proposal on your own if your goal is to develop a research project for INTEG 420 (the Senior Honours Project), but otherwise I expect you to collaborate with two or three of your peers. The proposal can build on one of your mini-proposals, but it does not have to. The research proposal should include all the same components as the mini-proposals, but the ideas should be more developed. In addition, the research proposal should include a literature review (no more than 5-8 well-chosen peer reviewed articles or 2 books), a discussion and justification of the methods you will use to analyze your data, and a schedule for the various stages of the research. --> <!-- Some guidelines for writing a research proposal are provided in the Babbie and Roberts book. The grading rubric is based in part on the recommendations discussed in. The grading rubric is available online at: [here](http://www.johnmclevey.com/research-proposal-rubric/). --><br><br><!-- If you collaborate on the research proposal, you must include an attachments detailing the exact contributions that each collaborator made to the development of the proposal (2-4 sentences each). -->
## 4 Mini Research Proposals


In addition to your final research proposal, you will collaborate (in groups of 3-4) on four different mini-proposals: (1) one for a quantitative project, (2) one for a qualitative project, (3) one for an experimental / audit study, and (4) one for a content analysis. You may work with different students on each proposal if you like. It is not necessary to have a completely new topic for each mini-proposal. Each mini-proposal is limited to 650 words. You must edit your work very carefully. There are no words to waste! <br><br>Each proposal must identify a general problem, pose a few good research questions, operationalize key concepts, propose reasonable hypotheses, propose and justify a sampling strategy, explain how data will be collected, and then explain what the expected contribution of the work will be. Finally, each proposal must include a paragraph, approved by all authors, that clearly describes what each person contributed (2-4 sentences per person). Unless there is a problem, everyone will receive the same grade.
## Engagement / Participation


The quality of this course -- like any other -- depends on you being engaged. Your participation grade will be based on (a) contributions to class discussion, (b) small group discussion, (c) your involvement in any online discussions, and (d) attendance. If you *really* don't like speaking up in class, you can participate more online, but you *must* speak with me about this. Although I will not be assigning a participation grade until the end of the semester, I am happy to provide qualitative feedback on your participation throughout the semester. <br><br> <!-- I will be tracking attendance using the attendance register in LEARN. Your attendance will be recorded as either (1) present, (2) absent, (3) late, or (4) excused.  -->If you arrive more than 10 minutes late, you will lose 50% of the credit for attending class. In other words, arriving late twice is equivalent to missing a class. There is no penalty for excused absences, which *always* require advance notice and generally require a note from a doctor.

# Detailed Schedule and Learning Objectives

Most of the class descriptions below include <strong>suggested</strong> readings and / or videos in addition to required reading and videos. I have included these to help you go a bit further than what we cover in class. You will not lose any points if you decide not dig into the suggested material. You will not be disadvantaged in class either, since I will not likely bring this material up in class.

# Course Policies

## Submitting Work & Grading Process

I will only grade work that you submit electronically.

Text matching software will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all materials and sources in assignments is documented. Students will be given an option if they do not want to have their assignment screened by [Turnitin](http://www.turnitin.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0YXlg8T_1QIVBJJpCh0kLQUVEAAYAiAAEgJmb_D_BwE). If you do not wish to submit your work to Turnitin, you can schedule a meeting with me to discuss your submissions in person.

## Late Policy

I will deduct **5 points** a day for every day, or part of a day, that your work is late, including weekends. I will not make exceptions without a medical note.

## Laptops and the Facebook Penalty

Laptops may be used in the classroom on the honors system, *but you must sit in the designated laptop section*. I reserve the right to modify this policy if laptops appear to be interfering with student learning. If I see Facebook, email, an IM client other than [#slack](https://integ340-winter2018.slack.com), a newspaper story, a blog, or *any* other content not related to the class, I will remove 1 point from your participation grade on the spot.

## Communication

We will be using the collaboration tool [#slack](https://integ120-2017.slack.com/) for regular class communication. I use the do not disturb settings on [#slack](https://integ120-2017.slack.com/), so I will not see any messages you send me outside of normal working hours. You are free to email me, of course, but I tend to respond to slack messages from students faster than I respond to emails. There are free [#slack](https://integ120-2017.slack.com/) apps for Mac OS X, Linux (beta), Windows (beta), iOS, and Android.

## Feedback

I will solicit brief, informal, and confidential course evaluations throughout the semester. These will only take a few minutes of your time. The purpose is to make sure that we are moving at a comfortable pace, that you feel you understand the material, and that my teaching style is meeting your needs. I will use this ongoing feedback to make adjustments as the course progresses. Although you are not obligated to do so, please fill out the evaluations so that I can make this the best learning experience for you, and the best teaching experience for me.

# On Campus Resources

## Access Ability Services

The AccessAbility Office, located in Needles Hall, Room 1132, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with the AccessAbility Office at the beginning of each academic term.

## Mental Health

The University of Waterloo, the Faculty of Environment, and our Departments consider students' well-being to be extremely important. We recognize that throughout the term students may face health challenges -- physical and / or emotional. Please note that help is available. Mental health is a serious issue for everyone and can affect your ability to do your best work. Counselling Services is an inclusive, non-judgmental, and confidential space for anyone to seek support. They offer confidential counselling for a variety of areas including anxiety, stress management, depression, grief, substance use, sexuality, relationship issues, and much more.

## The Writing Centre

Although I will be giving you feedback on your work throughout the term, I encourage you to make appointments with people at the writing centre. Their services are available to all UW students.

# University Policies

## Academic Integrity

In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility.

We will all uphold academic integrity policies at University of Waterloo, which include but are not limited to promoting academic freedom and a community free from discrimination and harassment. You can educate yourself on these policies -- and the disciplinary processes in place to deal with violations -- on the Office of Academic Integrity website.

A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, to avoid committing academic offense, and to take responsibility for his/her actions. A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offense, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offenses (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about 'rules' for group work / collaboration should seek guidance from the course professor, academic advisor, or the Undergraduate Associate Dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to Policy 71, Student Discipline. For typical penalties, check Guidelines for Assessment of Penalties.

## Grievances and Appeals

A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of his / her university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read Policy 70: Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4. When in doubt please contact your Undergraduate Advisor for details.

A decision made or penalty imposed under Policy 70 -- Student Petitions and Grievances (other than a petition) or Policy 71 -- (Student Discipline) may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes he/she has a ground for an appeal should refer to Policy 72 (Student Appeals).

## Religious Observances

Student needs to inform the instructor at the beginning of term if special accommodation needs to be made for religious observances that are not otherwise accounted for in the scheduling of classes and deliverables.
