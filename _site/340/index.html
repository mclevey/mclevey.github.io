You will learn about core issues in research design (e.g. sampling) that transcend specific approaches, and about a variety of techniques for collecting and analyzing quantitative and qualitative data. The course will cover both abstract and practical issues related to methodology and decision making in empirical research. You will have the opportunity to develop and workshop proposals that you may wish to pursue in your senior honors thesis. By the end of the course you will be a more informed consumer and have a basic set of skills for designing and implementing your own empirical research projects. Most importantly, you will have a foundation for future learning about research design and methods.<p><h1 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h1><p>The <a href="#sched">Schedule</a> section of the syllabus identifies the core learning objectives for every scheduled topic in the course.<h1 id="books">Books</h1><p>There are 2 books that we will read cover to cover. They are available on reserve at the university library (Porter), in the university bookstore, and online.<p><i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i> <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Fundamentals-Social-Research-Earl-Babbie/dp/017657011X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1512437506&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Fundamentals+of+Social+Research">Earl Babbie and Lance Roberts. 2018. <em>Fundamentals of Social Research.</em> Nelson.</a><p>This book is used in other research methods classes on campus, so you should be able to find used copies without too much difficulty. If for some reason you can’t get this edition, it’s OK to use a previous one. However, you <em>must</em> talk to me about how you can compensate for differences in the content across editions. <strong>If at all possible</strong>, I would prefer for you to use the 4th edition (i.e. the 2017 edition).<p><i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i> <a href="http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/preface/">Matthew Salganik. 2017. <em>Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age.</em> Princeton University Press.</a><p>You can currently read Salganik’s book for free online at <a href="http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/preface/">http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/preface/</a>.

You can do them on your own time, wherever you want, with or without your textbook, but <strong>you must complete them independently</strong>. No collaboration of any kind. The quizzes will be due at <strong>9 pm on every Monday and Wednesday between January 8 and March 14th, except reading week</strong>. LEARN will not let you submit a late quiz. If you need to submit late, please email me a medical note and request that I re-open the quiz for you.<br /><br />Each quiz will consist exclusively of multiple choice and, in some cases, true / false questions. You should expect each quiz to have a lot of questions (usually between 30 and 60), but if you have done the readings carefully you should be able to complete each quiz in less than 20-30 minutes. <br /><br />I suggest that you: (1) do the assigned readings carefully; (2) answer as many questions as you can without consulting your book; (3) when you get to the end of the quiz, go back to your book and re-read the sections that explain content you were unsure about; (4) go back to your quiz and answer the remaining questions, and (5) Submit! <br /><br /> Obviously it will take you longer than 20 minutes to do each quiz if you use this strategy, but the extra time you invest will pay off. <a href="https://makeitstick.net">This approach will help you learn better and more efficiently</a>. You will retain more information from each chapter, which will help you avoid problems later in the term.<br /><br />Each quiz will cover content from the <strong>readings that are scheduled for the upcoming class.</strong> In other words, the quiz covering the readings for January 9th’s class on “theory-driven empirical research” will cover Chapter 1 “Human Inquiry and Science” from Babbie &amp; Roberts (2018) <em>Fundamentals of Social Research</em>. The quiz will become available on LEARN after class on Thursday January 4th, and will close on Monday January 8th.<br /><br />Why have I decided to quiz you on readings before we cover them in class? And why are there so many questions on each quiz? Reasonable questions… The main reason why I have scheduled the quizzes this way is because it enables me to tailor our class meetings to meet your intellectual needs as they evolve throughout the semester. Every Tuesday and Thursday morning, I will look at the results of the quiz you submitted the night before. If necessary, I will revise my notes for the class meeting to clarify things you seem to be struggling with. Similarly, the reason I have included so many questions on each quiz is because I need to know exactly what you don’t understand. If I ask you a few questions about each of the key concepts from each chapter, then there end up being a lot of questions on each quiz. I think that’s fair, since all the questions are multiple choice and true / false.<br /><br />I have enabled auto-grading for the quizzes on LEARN. That means that you will get your evaluation as soon as you finish the quiz, and you will be able to see the correct answers for all questions. I set it up this way to help you learn <a href="https://makeitstick.net">as efficiently as possible</a>.<br /><br /><h2 id="class-facilitation">Class Facilitation</h2><p>You will collaborate with 4-5 students (approximately 1/4 of the class as of January 3rd) on a 30 minute class covering one chapter from Matthew Salganik’s book <em>Bit by Bit</em>. Eligible chapters are: “Observing Behavior,” “Asking Questions,” “Running Experiments,” and “Mass Collaboration.” We will pick collaborators and chapters in class on February 15th. The student-led classes will happen on March 22 and 27.<br /><br />You and your collaborators should begin with an overview of the core arguments from the chapter. You should explicitly relate those arguments to relevant material covered in the Babbie and Roberts’ textbook or in previous class discussions. For example, if you are covering the <em>Bit by Bit</em> chapter “Asking Questions,” you should connect the key arguments to content on survey methodology and qualitative interviews covered in Babbie and Roberts. Once you and your collaborators have reviewed the key material from your <em>Bit by Bit</em> chapter, you should pose questions for class discussion. <br /><br />Each chapter in <em>Bit by Bit</em> includes a technical appendix, further commentary, and a list of potential activities. It is <strong>not necessary</strong> for you to cover any of this material in your 30 minute class, but you should pick a couple of activities that you think are especially interesting or useful. If both groups stick to 30 minutes, there will be 20 minutes of remaining class time on March 22 and 27th. We will use that time to start (and maybe finish) one of the activities. <br /><br /><h2 id="4-mini-research-proposals">4 Mini Research Proposals</h2><p>In addition to your final research proposal, you will collaborate (in groups of 3-4) on four different mini-proposals: (1) one for a quantitative project, (2) one for a qualitative project, (3) one for an experimental / audit study, and (4) one for a content analysis. You may work with different students on each proposal if you like. It is not necessary to have a completely new topic for each mini-proposal. Each mini-proposal is limited to 650 words. You must edit your work very carefully. There are no words to waste! <br /><br />Each proposal must identify a general problem, pose a few good research questions, operationalize key concepts, propose reasonable hypotheses, propose and justify a sampling strategy, explain how data will be collected, and then explain what the expected contribution of the work will be. Finally, each proposal must include a paragraph, approved by all authors, that clearly describes what each person contributed (2-4 sentences per person). Unless there is a problem, everyone will receive the same grade.<h2 id="engagement--participation">Engagement / Participation</h2><p>The quality of this course – like any other – depends on you being engaged. Your participation grade will be based on (a) contributions to class discussion, (b) small group discussion, (c) your involvement in any online discussions, and (d) attendance. If you <em>really</em> don’t like speaking up in class, you can participate more online, but you <em>must</em> speak with me about this. Although I will not be assigning a participation grade until the end of the semester, I am happy to provide qualitative feedback on your participation throughout the semester. <br /><br /> If you arrive more than 10 minutes late, you will lose 50% of the credit for attending class. In other words, arriving late twice is equivalent to missing a class. There is no penalty for excused absences, which <em>always</em> require advance notice and generally require a note from a doctor.<h1 id="course-schedule">COURSE SCHEDULE</h1><table><thead><tr><th>Date<th>Topic<tbody><tr><td>Thursday Jan 04<td>Introduction + How to study for and succeed in this course<tr><td>Tuesday Jan 09<td>Theory-driven Empirical Research<tr><td>Thursday Jan 11<td>Paradigms, Theory, and Research<tr><td>Tuesday Jan 16<td>Research Ethics<tr><td>Thursday Jan 18<td>Research Design and the Logic of Causation<tr><td>Tuesday Jan 23<td>Conceptualization, Operationalization, and Measurement<tr><td>Thursday Jan 25<td>Indexes and Scales<tr><td>Tuesday Jan 30<td>The Logic of Sampling, Part 1<tr><td>Thursday Feb 01<td>The Logic of Sampling, Part 2<tr><td>Tuesday Feb 06<td>Experiments<tr><td>Thursday Feb 08<td>Survey Research<tr><td>Tuesday Feb 13<td>Non-Reactive Research<tr><td>Thursday Feb 15<td>Field Research<tr><td>Tuesday Feb 20<td>Reading Week, No Classes<tr><td>Thursday Feb 22<td>Reading Week, No Classes<tr><td>Tuesday Feb 27<td>Qualitative Interviewing<tr><td>Thursday Mar 01<td>Evaluation and Action Research<tr><td>Tuesday Mar 06<td>Qualitative Data Analysis<tr><td>Thursday Mar 08<td>Quantitative Data Analysis<tr><td>Tuesday Mar 13<td>The Logic of Multivariate Analysis<tr><td>Thursday Mar 15<td>Social Statistics<tr><td>Tuesday Mar 20<td>Reading and Writing Social Research + Digital Data<tr><td>Thursday Mar 22<td>Digital Data + Observing Behavior + Asking Questions<tr><td>Tuesday Mar 27<td>Digital Data + Running Experiments + Mass Collaboration<tr><td>Thursday Mar 29<td>Revisiting Ethics + The Future of Social Research</table><h1 id="detailed-schedule-and-learning-objectives">Detailed Schedule and Learning Objectives</h1><p>Most of the class descriptions below include <strong>suggested</strong> readings and / or videos in addition to required reading and videos.
