My students and I develop scientific software in support of our computational social science research. The packages we develop and contribute to have evolved over the years, depending on what problems we face in my various [research projects](http://www.johnmclevey.com/research/).

* `metaknowledge`: A Python package for quantitative and social networks research in the sociology of science and information science. Developed by Reid McIlroy-Young and John McLevey. First released in 2015. Under active development. Website and documentation: [http://networkslab.org/metaknowledge/](http://networkslab.org/metaknowledge/).
* `Nate`: A Python package for network-based text analysis. Developed by John McLevey. Under active development. Website and documentation: Coming soon...
* `pdpp`: A Python package for principled data processing, Python. Developed by Pierson Browne, Tyler Crick, and Rachel Wood. First released in 2015. Under active development. Website and documentation: Coming soon...
* `divsim`: A Python package computing measures of diversity and similarity in networks discussed in the paper by McLevey, Graham, Browne, and Crick. Developed by Tyler Crick, Alexander Graham, and John McLevey. Under active development. Website and documentation: Coming soon...
* `tidyextractors`: A Python package for extracting quantitative datasets from source code repositories, email mbox files, and social media APIs (currently Twitter). Developed and maintained by Joel Becker. Website and documentation: [http://networkslab.org/tidyextractors/](http://networkslab.org/tidyextractors/)
* Contributions to Jonathan de Bruin's Python package `recordlinkage`: A Python package for linking records across multiple data sources when there is no unique ID available. NetLab contributions are focused on implementing new comparison and fusion algorithms that are necessary for advancing my grant-funded empirical research on the structure and evolution of cross-sectoral collaboration networks in science and technology. Most NetLab contributions to \emph{recordlinkage} are implemented by Joel Becker (RA) and occasionally Jillian Anderson (RA), and then submitted to Jonathan de Bruin as pull requests.
* `gitnet`: A Python package for mining source code repository and mailing list data and generating network datasets. Developed by Joel Becker, Jillian Anderson, Steve McColl, and John McLevey. First released in 2016. `gitnet` is still publicly available and functional, but development efforts and maintenance have shifted to `tidyextractors` and other Python packages.
