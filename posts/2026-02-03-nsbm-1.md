# Nested Stochastic Blockmodels Part 1
John McLevey
2026-02-03

This is the first in a series of posts exploring nested stochastic blockmodels (NSBMs) for network analysis. We’ll use the `graph-tool` library to fit and visualize these models.

## Introduction

Stochastic blockmodels are generative models for networks that assume nodes can be grouped into blocks (communities) with characteristic connection patterns between them.

## Setup

Let’s start by importing the necessary libraries.

``` python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

print("Libraries loaded successfully!")
print(f"NumPy version: {np.__version__}")
print(f"Pandas version: {pd.__version__}")
```

    Libraries loaded successfully!
    NumPy version: 2.3.3
    Pandas version: 2.3.2

## Next Steps

In the next post, we’ll load a real network and fit our first nested SBM.
