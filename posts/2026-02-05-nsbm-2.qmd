In this second post, we continue our exploration of nested stochastic blockmodels by fitting a model to the political blogs network.

## Loading the Network

Let's start by loading our network data and examining its structure.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Create a simple example adjacency matrix
np.random.seed(42)
n_nodes = 10
adjacency = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(n_nodes, n_nodes))
adjacency = (adjacency + adjacency.T) // 2  # Make symmetric
np.fill_diagonal(adjacency, 0)

df = pd.DataFrame(adjacency,
                  columns=[f"node_{i}" for i in range(n_nodes)],
                  index=[f"node_{i}" for i in range(n_nodes)])

print("Example adjacency matrix:")
print(df)
```

## Summary Statistics

```{python}
total_edges = adjacency.sum() // 2
density = total_edges / (n_nodes * (n_nodes - 1) / 2)
print(f"Number of nodes: {n_nodes}")
print(f"Number of edges: {total_edges}")
print(f"Network density: {density:.3f}")
```

## Next Steps

In the next post, we'll fit the actual nested SBM and visualize the results.
