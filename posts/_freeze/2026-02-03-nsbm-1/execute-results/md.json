We'll use the `graph-tool` library to fit and visualize these models.\n\n## Introduction\n\nStochastic blockmodels are generative models for networks that assume nodes can be grouped into blocks (communities) with characteristic connection patterns between them.\n\n## Setup\n\nLet's start by importing the necessary libraries.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nprint(\"Libraries loaded successfully!\")\nprint(f\"NumPy version: {np.__version__}\")\nprint(f\"Pandas version: {pd.__version__}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLibraries loaded successfully!\nNumPy version: 2.3.3\nPandas version: 2.3.2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIn the next post, we'll load a real network and fit our first nested SBM.\n\n",
