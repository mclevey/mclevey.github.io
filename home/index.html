<p>I&rsquo;m an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/knowledge-integration/">Department of Knowledge Integration (KI)</a> at the University of Waterloo, and am cross-appointed to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/sociology-and-legal-studies/">Sociology &amp; Legal Studies</a> and the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/environment-resources-and-sustainability/">School of Environment, Resources, &amp; Sustainability</a>. I&rsquo;m also an Affiliated Researcher at the <a href="http://wici.ca">Waterloo Institute for Complexity and Innovation</a>, a Policy Fellow at the <a href="https://www.balsillieschool.ca">Balsillie School of International Affairs</a>, and a board member for the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/survey-research-centre/">University of Waterloo Survey Research Center</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a sociologist by training, but my work is increasingly interdisciplinary. I primarily work in the areas of social network analysis and computational social science, with substantive interests in science, education, and public policy; political sociology; and environmental sociology. My work typically combines established sociological theories and methods (e.g. surveys, interviews) with computational methods (especially statistical network models and automated text analysis) to address debates in social science, informatics, and public policy. Eventually, I&rsquo;ll get around to writing up a more detailed description. For now, you can browse some of the articles linked below. My work is currently funded by 8 research grants, including an <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/early-researcher-awards">Early Researcher Award from</a> from the Ministry of Research and Innovation in Ontario and 5 Grants from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC).</p>

<p>In addition to writing articles, I am co-developing research software with student members of my research team.  You can learn more about <a href="http://networkslab.org/metaknowledge/">metaknowledge</a> and our other research software <a href="research/software/">here</a> and on my <a href="http://networkslab.org/">NetLab</a> website. I recently published an article about <em>metaknowledge</em> (with Reid McIlroy-Young) in <em>Journal of Informetrics</em>. You can read it <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157716302000">here</a>.</p>

<p>I primarily teach courses on research methods and design, computational social science, science and public policy, and the art and science of learning. I also run the Knowledge Integration senior project / thesis course. I primarily work with graduate students from the Department of Sociology &amp; Legal Studies, but I have also worked with students from departments in the Faculty of Environment and the Faculty of Applied Health Sciences.</p>
