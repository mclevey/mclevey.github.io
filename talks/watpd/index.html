<font color="#D9B310">Week 1: A Research Mindset</font>    

<small>This week will set the tone for the course by laying out the value and power of a research mindset, and by explaining how a broad range of research methodologies can help us advance knowledge. This will include a consideration of how ethics can and should shape research projects, and what is involved in doing “socially responsible” research. Then we cover material on how to formulate good questions about important problems. There will be a particular emphasis on learning how to mitigate cognitive biases (e.g. confirmation bias and motivated reasoning) in the research process and allow for the possibility of surprise.</small>

<font color="#D9B310">Week 2: Research Design</font>    

<small>This class will focus on research design, and will build on the themes introduced in the previous week (e.g. how to design ethical and socially responsible research, how to mitigate cognitive biases and ask good questions that allow for the possibility of surprise). More specifically, it will cover the iterative process of turning a vague interest or curiosity into a researchable problem through conceptualization, operationalization, and the careful development of “measures.” (While not all methodologies use the language of conceptualization, operationalization, and measurement equally, analogous processes can be found in nearly all empirical research projects. This is a theme that will come up repeatedly.)</small>

<font color="#D9B310">Week 3: The Logic of Sampling</font>    

<small>Research always requires sampling of one kind or another – even in the age of “big data.” Sampling is all about making appropriate decisions (or evaluating already-made decisions) about where to look, what to read, who to talk to, and when to do it. Getting a handle on how to match sampling strategies with research goals in the context of real world constraints can be challenging, especially since there is so much intellectual diversity within and across the disciplines, and within and between quantitative, qualitative, archival, and experimental methodologies. In this section, I will provide an overview of the many types of probability and non-probability samples that researchers often draw, whether formally or informally. In all cases, I will explain why certain types of samples may be drawn, and what their general strengths and weaknesses are.</small>

<font color="#D9B310">Week 4: Reviewing Literature</font>    

<small>This week will provide an overview the many digital databases that can be used to find relative literature. We will consider a wide-range of databases available through the University of Waterloo library, but we will place a particular emphasis on PubMed, the Web of Science, and JSTOR. Following this general introduction to searching databases, we will move onto methodologies for conducting systematic reviews. As the amount of research produced every year grows (exponentially!), methodologies for research synthesis are becoming increasingly important. We will conclude with an overview of the movement for systematic research synthesis in the population health, social, and medical sciences.</small>

<font color="#D9B310">Week 5: The Logic of Quantitative Inquiry</font>    

<small>This week will be an introduction to the general logic of two types of quantitative inquiry. First, it will intro- duce the iterative logic of exploratory data analysis, including computing summary statistics and producing data visualizations that help the researcher better understand her data. Then, we will move onto an overview of the basic logic of probability, inference, and hypothesis testing. Although we will not go into any detail on the specifics of approaches to quantitative modelling, students will have a general framework that will make future learning – including experiential learning – easier.</small>

<font color="#D9B310">Week 6: The Logic of Qualitative Inquiry</font>    

<small>This week will cover the basic logic of empirical qualitative research. In particular, students will learn about the strengths and limitations of the two dominant approaches to qualitative data collection: participant observation and qualitative interviewing. Students will also learn practical strategies for establishing rapport with participants and how to have potentially sensitive or difficult conversations with strangers. Next, we will review the most common approaches qualitative data analysis, emphasizing different objectives and practices of interpretive and causal approaches. I will then provide a practical introduction to the iterative nature of coding in qualitative research, showing the lifecycle from raw data and first-cycle codes to final conclusions.</small>

<font color="#D9B310">Week 7: The Logic of Experimental Inquiry</font>    

<small>This week will be an introduction to the logic of experimental research. Following a general overview, students will learn about how experimental methodologies are employed in (1) “big data” research and (2) policy-oriented social research about discrimination in labour markets.</small>

<font color="#D9B310">Week 8: The Logic of Archival Research</font>    

<small>We will compare strategies that historians, social scientists, and some humanists employ for doing research with documents and other “found data.” In particular, we will emphasize the differences between working with curated and un-curated archives, and between paper and digital archives. In both cases, we will discuss the differences between research with documents in conditions of abundance vs. scarcity. We will discuss examples of archival research by historians and social scientists.</small>

<font color="#D9B310">Week 9: Mixed Methods</font>    

<small>This week introduces the general motivation for conducting mixed-methods research, and then compares two different approaches: mixed data-collection, and mixed data-analysis. We will then move onto a discussion of how to do mixed-methods research in a team setting.</small>

<font color="#D9B310">Week 10: Writing and Presenting Research</font>    

<small>Finally, the course will end with a section on how to effectively communicate research results. The main emphasis will be on writing reports and designing slides and posters. This will include a brief introduction to research on vision and pattern-recognition that is relevant to designing effective information visualizations in quantitative, qualitative, experimental, and archival research.</small>
