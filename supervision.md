I am interested in working with students on projects in the areas of social network analysis / network science, computational social science or data science, sociology of science, environmental sociology, and political sociology.

For the most part, I supervise graduate students from the Department of Sociology & Legal Studies and undergraduate students from the Department of Knowledge Integration, but I have also worked with students from other departments in the faculties of Environment, Science, and Applied Health Sciences.
