    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p class="intro">My work focuses on computational methods for social science, with applications in science studies, political sociology, and environmental politics.</p>

<!-- UPDATE AND FOCUS PERSONAL ACCOUNT AROUND:
1. theoretical and methodological foundations of belief formation and change
2. generative models of information operations and disinformation campaigns
3. computational text analysis of online political discussions
4. factorial experiments and computational simulations of belief networks for polarization and cultural change
5. the role of face to face and online in mobilization into environmental activism
6. privacy, AI, agentic AI systems, belief formation and risk perception and assessment
7. collaborative work with Ally, Meghan, Matt, and others

You also want to think about the future IG (November)? Also, clearly you have NO MORE SPACE for projects this year.

<!-- 
<p>My current research addresses three broad and longstanding themes that cut across the social, cognitive, and computational/statistical sciences. First, I am developing generative models of schematic cognition, social influence, and cultural learning to deepen our knowledge of how latent opinions, identities, beliefs, and behaviors form and co-evolve, and to better measure polarization and large-scale cultural change. In developing these models, I am primarily focused on culture related to (a) climate change and environmental policy; (a) harm reduction initiatives and public health responses to the toxic drug supply and overdose crisis; (c) generative artificial intelligence; (d) privacy, security, and surveillance; and (e) lifestyle preferences and politics.</p>

<p>Second, I am using these models as digital ’laboratories’ (of a sort) to better understand the workings and impacts of coordinated information operations such as disinformation campaigns and censorship on populations. Third, I am using data from social media platforms to better understand the role of emotional dynamics and identity-related processes in online political discussions. I approach each of these projects as a computational social scientist with expertise in network science and social network analysis, probabilistic and generative modelling, and computational text analysis.</p>

<p>My work is funded by research grants from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and an Early Researcher Award from the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation.
