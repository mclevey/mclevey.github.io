<p>The internet is changing the way that knowledge is made and shared.
Knowledge-making in face-to-face settings is being replaced by
information gathering from remote sources, whose origins may be
concealed but which can create an illusion of intimacy. Though remote
communication is beneficial in many ways – modern societies would fail
without it – and though the tight boundaries of the face-to-face can be
used for evil purposes such as criminal conspiracy, if the overall trend
to remote communication continues unchecked, it could be disastrous for
the future of democracy and the very idea of truth itself. Too much
reliance on remote communication threatens the core institutions of
democratic societies.</p>
<p>We explain the change in technical detail, from a systematic analysis
of the workings of the face-to-face to a high level setting-out of its
dangerous political implications. The analysis includes field studies,
reflexive examination, drawing on the wide experience of the authors, of
the stickiness of the face-to-face in our own work and other
institutions, and network analysis which explains the illusion of
intimacy that can be generated inadvertently or maliciously. We look at
the apparent effectiveness of techniques such as blockchain and the
limits of their domain. New information is provided about the malicious
use of disinformation by foreign powers. We dramatise the dangers to
Western pluralist democracy through a personal accounting of the 2020
American election.</p>
<p>By drawing out the special features of face-to-face interaction and
its constitutive role in creating societies, with science as the icon,
the book sets out an agenda for civic education that can protect
democratic institutions from the erosion of pluralism and the facile
abandonment of trustworthy expertise. The authors conclude by returning
to the themes set out at the start of the book, namely the crucial role
played by trust in modern societies and the importance of face-to-face
interactions in reproducing that trust, and the democratic institutions
in which it should be invested.</p>
