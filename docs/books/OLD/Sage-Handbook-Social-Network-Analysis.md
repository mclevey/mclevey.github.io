# Description

This new edition of *The Sage Handbook of Social Network Analysis* builds on the success of its predecessor, offering a comprehensive overview of social network analysis produced by leading international scholars in the field.

Brand new chapters provide both significant updates to topics covered in the first edition, as well as discussing cutting edge topics that have developed since, including new chapters on (1) general issues such as social categories and computational social science; (2) applications in contexts such as environmental policy, gender, ethnicity, cognition and social media and digital networks; and (3) concepts and methods such as centrality, blockmodeling, multilevel network analysis, spatial analysis, data collection, and beyond.

By providing authoritative accounts of the history, theories and methodology of various disciplines and topics, the second edition of *The SAGE Handbook of Social Network Analysis* is designed to provide a state-of-the-art presentation of classic and contemporary views, and to lay the foundations for the further development of the area.
