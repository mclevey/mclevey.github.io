        <h3>Quantitative Research Methods</h3>
        <p>This course introduces students to foundational concepts, principles, and practices in contemporary quantitative social science. Core topics include research computing, data collection and processing, descriptive and inferential statistics, measurement, visualization, and statistical modelling. Research ethics, transparency and reproducibility, and effective communication are emphasized throughout.</p>
        <p>
          This course follows the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences' <strong>Quantitative Reasoning Course Guidelines</strong>
          (see <span>www.mun.ca/hss/qr</span>).

        <h3>Networks, Culture, and Social Control</h3>
        <p>This course introduces students to social network analysis in sociology and criminology, emphasizing how patterns of relationships shape behavior, meaning, and social outcomes. Topics include personal networks, belief polarization, organized crime, and institutional deviance.</p>

    <h1>Graduate Supervision</h1>

    <p class="intro">I supervise graduate students working on computational social science, network analysis, political sociology, and related areas.</p>

    <h2>Prospective Students</h2>
    <p>I welcome inquiries from prospective graduate students interested in computational approaches to social research. Strong candidates typically have background in quantitative methods, programming (Python preferred), and substantive interests in political sociology, science studies, or environmental sociology.</p>

    <h2>Current Students</h2>
    <p>Information about current graduate students coming soon.</p>

    <h2>Past Students</h2>
    <p>Information about past graduate students coming soon.</p>

        <p>Computational Social Science Symposium<br>January 2026, Dalhousie University, Halifax NS, Canada</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Introduction to Topic Modelling</h3>
        <p>This workshop introduces the core concepts, methods, and underlying logic of topic modelling for research. It is
        designed for researchers with little or no prior experience in quantitative text analysis who want to work with text
        data in their own projects. Participants will learn how to prepare and process text data, fit topic models, and assess
        and interpret the results. Examples are provided in Python, but the content is not specific to any particular
        programming language or software.</p>
