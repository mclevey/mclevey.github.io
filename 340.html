<p></p>
<p>This course provides an introduction to empirical research design and methods with a focus on applications in the social sciences. You will learn a variety of techniques for collecting and analyzing quantitative and qualitative data, and will have the opportunity to use some of these methods in real research projects. By the end of the course you will be a more informed consumer of empirical research and have a basic set of skills for designing and implementing your own empirical research projects. Most importantly, you will have a foundation for future learning about research design and methods. </p>
<p></p>
<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="#sched">Schedule</a> section of the syllabus identifies the core learning objectives for every scheduled topic in the course. </p>
<h2>Books</h2>
<p></p>
<p>There are 2 books that we will read cover to cover. They are available on reserve at the university library (Porter), in the university bookstore, and  online. </p>

<p></p>
<p>This book is used in other research methods classes on campus, so you should be able to find used copies without too much difficulty. If for some reason you can't get this edition, it's OK to use a previous one. However, you <em>must</em> talk to me about how you can compensate for differences in the content across editions. <strong>If at all possible</strong>, I would prefer for you to use the 4th edition (i.e. the 2017 edition).</p>

</table><br><p><strong>Comprehension Quizzes
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Although there are no exams in this course, there are 10 short quizzes to test your comprehension of the readings and other class material. The quizzes will be help every Thursday from January 11 to March 27 (except reading week), and will cover the material up to and including what we are doing that day. They will not include material already covered on previous quizzes. Each of these quizzes will take between 10 and 20 minutes and will consist of multiple choice, true / false, and short answer questions.</p>
<p><strong>Mini-Proposals
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In addition to your final research proposal, you will collaborate with two or three of your peers on three different mini-proposals: (1) one for a quantitative project, (2) one for a qualitative project, and (3) one for <em>either</em> an experiment / audit study, a content analysis, or an action research project. <br><br>Each mini-proposal is limited to 500 words. They must identify a general problem, pose a few answerable research questions, operationalize key concepts, propose and justify a sampling strategy, explain how data will be collected, and then explain what the expected contribution of the work will be. There are no words to waste! It is not necessary to have a completely new topic for each mini-proposal. </p>
<p><strong>Research Proposal
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>You will write a &lt;= 2,500 word proposal (again, don't waste words!) for an empirical research project. You may write the proposal on your own if your goal is to develop a research project for INTEG 420 (the Senior Honours Project), but otherwise I expect you to collaborate with two or three of your peers. The proposal can build on one of your mini-proposals, but it does not have to. The research proposal should include all the same components as the mini-proposals, but the ideas should be more developed. In addition, the research proposal should include a literature review (no more than 5-8 well-chosen peer reviewed articles or 2 books), a discussion and justification of the methods you will use to analyze your data, and a schedule for the various stages of the research. <!-- Some guidelines for writing a research proposal are provided in the Babbie and Roberts book. The grading rubric is based in part on the recommendations discussed in. The grading rubric is available online at: <a href="http://www.johnmclevey.com/research-proposal-rubric/">here</a>. --><br><br>If you collaborate on the research proposal, you must include an attachments detailing the exact contributions that each collaborator made to the development of the proposal (2-4 sentences each).</p>
<p><strong>Engagement / Participation
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The quality of this course -- like any other -- depends on you being engaged. Your participation grade will be based on (a) contributions to class discussion, (b) small group discussion, (c) your involvement in any online discussions, and (d) attendance. If you <em>really</em> don't like speaking up in class, you can participate more online, but you <em>must</em> speak with me about this. Although I will not be assigning a participation grade until the end of the semester, I am happy to provide qualitative feedback on your participation throughout the semester. <br><br> <!-- I will be tracking attendance using the attendance register in LEARN. Your attendance will be recorded as either (1) present, (2) absent, (3) late, or (4) excused.  -->If you arrive more than 10 minutes late, you will lose 50% of the credit for attending class. In other words, arriving late twice is equivalent to missing a class. There is no penalty for excused absences, which <em>always</em> require advance notice and generally require a note from a doctor. <!-- You can log on and view your attendance record under the "assessments" tab. The schedule at the end of this syllabus includes a unique ID for each class. The ID is also used in the attendance register. --></p>

<p></p>
<h1>Submitting Work &amp; Grading Process</h1>
<p></p>
<p>I will only grade work that you submit electronically. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Text matching software will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all materials and sources in assignments is documented. Students will be given an option if they do not want to have their assignment screened by <a href="http://www.turnitin.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0YXlg8T_1QIVBJJpCh0kLQUVEAAYAiAAEgJmb_D_BwE">Turnitin</a>. If you do not wish to submit your work to Turnitin, you can schedule a meeting with me to discuss your submissions in person. </p>
<p></p>
<h1>Late Policy</h1>
<p></p>
<p>I will deduct <strong>5 points</strong> a day for every day, or part of a day, that your work is late, including weekends. I will not make exceptions without a medical note. </p>
<p></p>
<h1>Laptops and the Facebook Penalty</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Laptops may be used in the classroom on the honors system, <em>but you must sit in the designated laptop section</em>. I reserve the right to modify this policy if laptops appear to be interfering with student learning. If I see Facebook, email, an IM client other than <a href="https://integ120-2017.slack.com/">#slack</a>, a newspaper story, a blog, or <em>any</em> other content not related to the class, I will remove 1 point from your participation grade on the spot. </p>
<p></p>
<h1>Communication</h1>
<p></p>
<p>We will be using the collaboration tool <a href="https://integ120-2017.slack.com/">#slack</a> for regular class communication. I use the do not disturb settings on <a href="https://integ120-2017.slack.com/">#slack</a>, so I will not see any messages you send me outside of normal working hours. You are free to email me, of course, but I tend to respond to slack messages from students faster than I respond to emails. There are free <a href="https://integ120-2017.slack.com/">#slack</a> apps for Mac OS X, Linux (beta), Windows (beta), iOS, and Android.</p>

<p></p>
<h1>Feedback</h1>
<p></p>
<p>I will solicit brief, informal, and confidential course evaluations throughout the semester. These will only take a few minutes of your time. The purpose is to make sure that we are moving at a comfortable pace, that you feel you understand the material, and that my teaching style is meeting your needs. I will use this ongoing feedback to make adjustments as the course progresses. Although you are not obligated to do so, please fill out the evaluations so that I can make this the best learning experience for you, and the best teaching experience for me.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>On Campus Resources</h2>
<p></p>
<h1>Access Ability Services</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The AccessAbility Office, located in Needles Hall, Room 1132, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with the AccessAbility Office at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>Mental Health</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The University of Waterloo, the Faculty of Environment, and our Departments consider students' well-being to be extremely important. We recognize that throughout the term students may face health challenges -- physical and / or emotional. Please note that help is available. Mental health is a serious issue for everyone and can affect your ability to do your best work. Counselling Services is an inclusive, non-judgmental, and confidential space for anyone to seek support. They offer confidential counselling for a variety of areas including anxiety, stress management, depression, grief, substance use, sexuality, relationship issues, and much more.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>The Writing Centre</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Although I will be giving you feedback on your work throughout the term, I encourage you to make appointments with people at the writing centre. Their services are available to all UW students.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>University Policies</h2>
<p></p>
<h1>Academic Integrity</h1>
<p></p>
<p>In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We will all uphold academic integrity policies at University of Waterloo, which include but are not limited to promoting academic freedom and a community free from discrimination and harassment. You can educate yourself on these policies -- and the disciplinary processes in place to deal with violations -- on the Office of Academic Integrity website.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, to avoid committing academic offense, and to take responsibility for his/her actions. A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offense, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offenses (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about 'rules' for group work / collaboration should seek guidance from the course professor, academic advisor, or the Undergraduate Associate Dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to Policy 71, Student Discipline. For typical penalties, check Guidelines for Assessment of Penalties.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>Grievances and Appeals</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of his / her university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read Policy 70: Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4. When in doubt please contact your Undergraduate Advisor for details.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A decision made or penalty imposed under Policy 70 -- Student Petitions and Grievances (other than a petition) or Policy 71 -- (Student Discipline) may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes he/she has a ground for an appeal should refer to Policy 72 (Student Appeals).</p>
<p></p>
<h1>Religious Observances</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Student needs to inform the instructor at the beginning of term if special accommodation needs to be made for religious observances that are not otherwise accounted for in the scheduling of classes and deliverables.</p>
