<p class="intro">
  Hi! 👋 I'm John (he/him).
</p>
<p class="intro">
  I'm Professor and Head of the <a href="https://www.mun.ca/sociology/">Department of Sociology & Criminology</a> at Memorial University (2025-present). Before moving to Memorial, I completed a PhD in Sociology at McMaster University (2013) and was a faculty member at the University of Waterloo for 11 years (2013-2024). I spent the last year of my time at Waterloo on parental leave with my partner Ally and our identical twins, Quinn and Nora.
</p>
<p class="intro">
  I work primarily in the areas of computational social science, network science, cultural cognition and affect, and quantitative methodology with substantive interests in political sociology, sociology of science, and environmental social science. My research has been funded by grants from a variety of sources, including the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and an Early Researcher Award from the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation.
