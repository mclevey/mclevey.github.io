<h1>Description</h1>

<p>Computational approaches offer exciting opportunities for us to do social science differently. This beginner's guide discusses a range of computational methods and how to use them to study the problems and questions you want to research.</p>

<p>It assumes no knowledge of programming, offering step-by-step guidance for coding in Python and drawing on examples of real data analysis to demonstrate how you can apply each approach in any discipline.</p>

<p>The book also:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Considers important principles of social scientific computing, including transparency, accountability and reproducibility.</li>
  <li>Understands the realities of completing research projects and offers advice for dealing with issues such as messy or incomplete data and systematic biases.</li>
  <li>Empowers you to learn at your own pace, with online resources including screencast tutorials and datasets that enable you to practice your skills and get up to speed.</li>
</ul>

<p>For anyone who wants to use computational methods to conduct a social science research project, this book equips you with the skills, good habits and best working practices to do rigorous, high quality work.</p>
