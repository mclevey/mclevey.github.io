			<br><a name="desc"></a><h1>Course Description</h1>
<p></p>
<p>We are living in an age where digital information is being produced at an unprecedented rate. This explosion of digital data has the potential to revolutionize the way we learn about the world, and how we conduct research related to urgent social and political problems. This course focuses primarily on the knowledge and skills necessary for doing high-quality research with digital data. We will begin by considering the promise and pitfalls of "big data" for social science, and on the intersection of research in social science and data science. Then we will start a research-oriented introduction to the programming language Python, followed by a series of classes on collecting, cleaning, and combining digital datasets. Finally, we will move into a series of classes on analyzing digital datasets using tools from machine learning, text analysis, and social network analysis. There will be an emphasis on good research design and ethics throughout the course. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I assume no previous knowledge or experience of computer programming. Previous courses in research methods and / or statistics are an asset, but are not required. The same goes for previous courses in the social sciences, especially sociology and political science. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><font color="#828282">In designing this course, I was influenced by (broadly) similar courses offered by the sociologists <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/index.shtml">Matthew Salganik</a> (Course: "<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/soc596_f2016/">Computational Social Science</a>" at Princeton University), <a href="http://www.lauraknelson.com/p/about.html">Laura Nelson</a> (Course: "<a href="http://www.lauraknelson.com/p/teaching.html">Digital Methods for Social Sciences and Humanities</a>" at Northeastern University), and <a href="http://www.chrisbail.net">Chris Bail</a> (Course: "<a href="http://www.chrisbail.net/p/learn-comp-soc.html">Computational Sociology</a>" at Duke University). I was also influenced by the general design of the "<a href="http://data8.org">Data 8: Foundations of Data Science</a>" course at UC Berkeley. </font></p>
<p></p>
<h1>Learning Objectives</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="#sched">Schedule</a> section of the syllabus identifies the core learning objectives for every scheduled topic in the course. </p>
<h1>Books</h1>
<p></p>
<p>There are 4 books that we will use extensively. They are available on reserve at the university library (Porter), in the university bookstore, and  online. One of them (<em>Python for Everybody: Exploring Data In Python 3</em>) is freely available online as a PDF file, ebook, or HTML book. Currently, you can read Salganik's book <em>Bit by Bit</em> online as an HTML book, but I'm not sure if it will stay online once the book becomes officially available in print.</p>
<p></p>

O'Reilly.</a> If the 2018 edition is available when you are purchasing this book, get the 2018 edition. If not, get the 2015 edition.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i> <a href="https://www.py4e.com/book.php">Charles Severance. 2016. <em>Python for Everybody: Exploring Data In Python 3</em></a>. Available for free online. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition to these books, you may find it occasionally helpful to consult other resources for learning Python, especially if you are interested in some specific area, such as natural language processing. I have <em>plenty</em> of suggestions of further things to read, so don't hesitate to ask.<!-- There are many excellent books published by O'Reilly. Jean Mark Gawron's *<a href="http://gawron.sdsu.edu/python_for_ss/course_core/book_draft/index.html">Python for Social Scientists</a>* is also a very good resource, and is fully available online for free.  --></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you have no previous knowledge of HTML or CSS, you might consider getting yourself a copy of Jon Duckett's (2011) <em><a href="http://www.htmlandcssbook.com">HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</a></em>. It's a nice (and beautiful) introduction that assumes no prior knowledge. Of course there are <em>plenty</em> of great resources online. You don't <em>need</em> to buy the book. Your web scraping skills will advance rapidly as you become more familiar with HTML and CSS. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Any other readings will be available on the course website, on reserve, or through the library database. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Many of our classes will be hands-on labs / workshops. I'll regularly walk the class through example code, but I will do so assuming that you have done the readings before coming to class. </p>
<p></p>
<h1>Computing</h1>
<p></p>
<p>You need to have access to a laptop, and you need to bring it to every class meeting from January 16th onwards. If that is not possible, talk to me as soon as you can and I will try to help you work out another option. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Before coming to class on January 16th, you should install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos">Anaconda for Python 3.6</a> on your laptop. Do not get Python 2.7. Get 3.6. Anaconda will install Python on your system, plus Jupyter Notebooks and many of the packages we will need for this course. We will install additional packages throughout the course as necessary. </p>
<p></p>
<p><br><center><img src="http://jupyter.org/assets/homepage.png" width = 500></p>
<p><small>Almost all of the computing we do in this course will be in Jupyter Notebooks.</small></center></p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition to Anaconda, you will need a good text editor. I use and love <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 3</a> and the <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom text editor</a>. For this class, I recommend that you install Atom, which is completely open source. </p>
<p></p>

</table><br></div><br><h2>Data Challenges
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>From January 16th onwards, there will be small programming exercises that you will work on during and outside of class. In addition to those small assignments, you will collaborate with one or two other people on "data challenges." These will be slightly more challenging or involved exercises where you will have to draw on the knowledge you have acquired to do something related to content we are covering in the course at the time (e.g. scrape a website of your choosing and write the results to a new dataset, generate and analyze a semantic network from unstructured text). The due dates for data challenges listed on this syllabus are actually the dates when I will give you the details of the data challenge, not when they are due. I will give you exactly one week to do the challenges. They will not actually take you that long to do, but I realize that you may wish to collaborate face-to-face and that requires dealing with scheduling constraints. <br><br>Finally, when you submit your data challenges, each person must include, as an appendix at the end of the notebook, a paragraph long personal self-assessment. More details on this in the section below. </p>
<h2>Self Assessments
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>There is a lot of diversity in this class. Some of you have a lot of experience programming, but most of you have none. Some of you have a lot of experience doing research in the social sciences, but most of you do not. It's always challenging to run a class like this when people have radically different starting points and backgrounds. But... it's also really fun and intellectually stimulating! <br><br>One of the key ways I will try to support everyone's individual progress is by relying on frequent honest self-assessments. Being honest is in your self-interest, because if you are not honest you will quickly get left behind, and if I have good reason to suspect you being intentionally dishonest, you risk loosing most or all of this part of your course grade. Be honest!<br><br>The self-assessments will happen in two ways. <em>Every class</em> you will complete a <em>very short</em> survey (&lt; 1 min long) consisting only of fixed-response questions and the occasional short answer question requiring no more than a couple of sentences. The second type of assessment you will do is qualitative. Each of the five collaborative data challenges you submit must include a paragraph-long qualitative self-assessment for every person on the team. I want to know what you did, what you learned, how you pushed yourself, and what you think you need to keep working on. You may also include other details as well, if you think they are relevant.<br><br>What am I looking for in these self-assessments? I will be using the quantitative assessments to inform how I deliver lectures, facilitate discussions, and run hands-on workshops during class meeting times. I will use the data to keep track of when you are pushing yourself to the limits of your comfort zone (and therefore putting yourself in a position to learn), and when you are not. Similarly, I will use the qualitative data, combined with my own observations, to better understand what you are doing to push yourself to learn. Obviously, the way to get top marks in this part of the course is to work hard and put yourself at the edge of your comfort zones regardless of where that might be, and regardless of where you started from. </p>
<h2>Tutorial Notebook
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>With one or two other collaborators, you will produce a Jupyter Notebook that introduces your fellow students to material from one of the chapters in <em>Scraping the Web with Python</em> or <em>Big Data and Social Science</em> that we are <strong>not</strong> already covering in class (e.g. one of the chapters on working with images, or forms and logins). Your notebook should include one or two complete examples with functional Python code and real data. You should also include a paragraph in the notebook that describes exactly what each member of your group contributed, and whether or not your group lived up to the original agreements for collaborating. You may also contact me privately if you want to talk about your collaboration. <br><br>I will provide a sign-up form at the start of class on February 15th (right before reading week). </p>
<h2>Final Paper / Report
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>With one or two other collaborators, you will produce a Jupyter notebook that answers an important or interesting research question by analyzing real data. All text, Python code, and output (e.g. graphs, tables) must be included in the Jupyter Notebook that you submit to me, along with your raw data. I should be able to reproduce your entire analysis as I work through your notebook. <strong>You can write about anything you want</strong>, but consider running the idea by me first. <br><br> Your notebook must begin with at least a few paragraphs describing the general problem your team is concerned with, the specific research questions you are addressing, and why the problem and questions are important or interesting. Your notebook must also include a discussion of the data you are analyzing, where it came from, what it's strengths and limitations are, and what methods you are going to use to analyze that data. (It is not necessary to use methods not covered in the course, although you may do so if you wish.) The findings section of your report must include inline visualizations and tables. Finally, you must interpret the meaning of what you found given the questions you asked, describe what you learned from this assignment, and describe any additional  data and / or analyses that you think would help your further the work you started with this notebook. <br><br>As with other collaborative work in this course, you should also include a paragraph in the notebook that describes exactly what each member of your group contributed, and whether or not your group lived up to the originally agreements for collaborating. You may also contact me privately if you want to talk about your collaboration. </p>
<h2>Engagement / Participation
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The quality of this course -- like any other -- depends on you being engaged. Your participation grade will be based on (a) contributions to class discussion, (b) small group discussion, (c) your involvement in any online discussions, and (d) attendance. If you <em>really</em> don't like speaking up in class, you can participate more online, but you <em>must</em> speak with me about this. Although I will not be assigning a participation grade until the end of the semester, I am happy to provide qualitative feedback on your participation throughout the semester. <br><br> If you arrive more than 10 minutes late, you will lose 50% of the credit for attending class. In other words, arriving late twice is equivalent to missing a class. There is no penalty for excused absences, which <em>always</em> require advance notice and generally require a note from a doctor. </p>

<a name="poli"></a><h1>Course Policies</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>Submitting Work &amp; Grading Process</h2>
<p></p>
<p>I will only grade work that you submit electronically. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Text matching software will be used to screen assignments in this course. This is being done to verify that use of all materials and sources in assignments is documented. Students will be given an option if they do not want to have their assignment screened by <a href="http://www.turnitin.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0YXlg8T_1QIVBJJpCh0kLQUVEAAYAiAAEgJmb_D_BwE">Turnitin</a>. If you do not wish to submit your work to Turnitin, you can schedule a meeting with me to discuss your submissions in person. </p>
<p></p>
<h2>Late Policy</h2>
<p></p>
<p>I will deduct <strong>5 points</strong> a day for every day, or part of a day, that your work is late, including weekends. I will not make exceptions without a medical note. </p>
<p></p>
<h2>Laptops and the Facebook Penalty</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Laptops may be used in the classroom on the honors system, <em>but you must sit in the designated laptop section</em>. I reserve the right to modify this policy if laptops appear to be interfering with student learning. If I see Facebook, email, an IM client other than <a href="https://integ120-2017.slack.com/">#slack</a>, a newspaper story, a blog, or <em>any</em> other content not related to the class, I will remove 1 point from your participation grade on the spot. </p>
<p></p>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<p></p>
<p>We will be using the collaboration tool <a href="https://integ120-2017.slack.com/">#slack</a> for regular class communication. I use the do not disturb settings on <a href="https://integ120-2017.slack.com/">#slack</a>, so I will not see any messages you send me outside of normal working hours. You are free to email me, of course, but I tend to respond to slack messages from students faster than I respond to emails. There are free <a href="https://integ120-2017.slack.com/">#slack</a> apps for Mac OS X, Linux (beta), Windows (beta), iOS, and Android.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p></p>
<p>I will solicit brief, informal, and confidential course evaluations throughout the semester. These will only take a few minutes of your time. The purpose is to make sure that we are moving at a comfortable pace, that you feel you understand the material, and that my teaching style is meeting your needs. I will use this ongoing feedback to make adjustments as the course progresses. Although you are not obligated to do so, please fill out the evaluations so that I can make this the best learning experience for you, and the best teaching experience for me.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>On Campus Resources</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>Access Ability Services</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The AccessAbility Office, located in Needles Hall, Room 1132, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with the AccessAbility Office at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Mental Health</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The University of Waterloo, the Faculty of Environment, and our Departments consider students' well-being to be extremely important. We recognize that throughout the term students may face health challenges -- physical and / or emotional. Please note that help is available. Mental health is a serious issue for everyone and can affect your ability to do your best work. Counselling Services is an inclusive, non-judgmental, and confidential space for anyone to seek support. They offer confidential counselling for a variety of areas including anxiety, stress management, depression, grief, substance use, sexuality, relationship issues, and much more.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>The Writing Centre</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Although I will be giving you feedback on your work throughout the term, I encourage you to make appointments with people at the writing centre. Their services are available to all UW students.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>University Policies</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p></p>
<p>In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We will all uphold academic integrity policies at University of Waterloo, which include but are not limited to promoting academic freedom and a community free from discrimination and harassment. You can educate yourself on these policies -- and the disciplinary processes in place to deal with violations -- on the Office of Academic Integrity website.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, to avoid committing academic offense, and to take responsibility for his/her actions. A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offense, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offenses (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about 'rules' for group work / collaboration should seek guidance from the course professor, academic advisor, or the Undergraduate Associate Dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to Policy 71, Student Discipline. For typical penalties, check Guidelines for Assessment of Penalties.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Grievances and Appeals</h2>
<p></p>
<p>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of his / her university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read Policy 70: Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4. When in doubt please contact your Undergraduate Advisor for details.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A decision made or penalty imposed under Policy 70 -- Student Petitions and Grievances (other than a petition) or Policy 71 -- (Student Discipline) may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes he/she has a ground for an appeal should refer to Policy 72 (Student Appeals).</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Religious Observances</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Student needs to inform the instructor at the beginning of term if special accommodation needs to be made for religious observances that are not otherwise accounted for in the scheduling of classes and deliverables.</p>
